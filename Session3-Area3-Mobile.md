* hover + click = tap + 2 tap
* how do you show the data in a hover elsewhere?
  * hold + find nearest point + show hover then
  * Show only one dimension (drag left to right?)
  * touchup/touchdown overwrite mouseevents
    * platform differences 
* mobile-first, how does it apply to data vis
  * simpler on mobile?
  * what if they don't come back to a desktop version?
    * browse vs explore
    * generate invitation
    * if they aren't hooked already, there's nothing you can do.
* continuitiy between mobile and desktop
* First look should be valuable (nyt interactives.)
* How does context affect your interface?
  * More context is better
  * what is more important? the text or the chart?
* contraints:
  mobile, tablet, web (and maybe orientation)
* mobile-separate, build desktop one first, design and build mobile.
  * build independend
  * infinite configurability will be costlier
  * extract common shared components
* on mobile give the answer, explore on desktop
* natural interactions on mobile on phone
  * pan and zoom, adjust scale, zoom in your data
* what about filters? 
* using scroll to reveal information instead of using click, reveal on scroll
* lean on native interfaces (dropdowns, calendar selection)
* barcharts vertical vs horizontal
* screenshot of fully functional thing, offer a simplified representation but alert
to the existance of more complex interface
* Use the text as interface to modify/highlight the visualization
  * Victor Powell's Pythagorian theorem setosa.io/pythagorian
* precompute things if you can on your server etc. don't do it on mobile.
* have links to certain states of a visualization, points you want to show people that are significant.
* tab regions need to be large
* graphprism (aggregating stats, filtering based on authority)
