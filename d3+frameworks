integrating d3 with js web-dev toolkits like anuglar.js

Pitches: Angular.js
angular's abstraction is elegant (like d3)
	e.g. can create custom html tags in angular, eg <my-map><my-map>


Pitches: Ember.js
Use case is 20 people each week working on codebase.  Revolving set of 20.
	Frameworks are useful for teams of large people and provides a common vocabulary and language for developers on a team.

Pitches: bootstrap
Helpful, but looks the same.  However, you can use the LESS files and compile a boostrappy base (grid layout, for example) instead of undoing styles in css.

Pitches: backbone.js
Interactive webapps has routers.  routers and urls are managed for you.
backbone is built on underscore.  

Challenge with framwork integration: rendering lifecycles (d3 and backbone are rendered differently at different times, so this is a problem to solve and synchronize).

Pitches: underscore.js
	ability to chain functions. (duplicate functionality exists within d3)

Who owns the DOM?  D3 is great for transitioning DOM.  Frameworks can be great for handling the model and D3 for the view.
